## Usage

Place the file anywhere, then to use it one-time-only:
```bash
hyfetch --ascii-file /wherever/you/put/the/file.txt
```

You can also alias this in your .bashrc, .zshrc or other shellrc file  
(if there's a config option for this, I didn't check lmao)
```bash
alias "hyfetch"="hyfetch --ascii-file /wherever.txt"
```
